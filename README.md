# Circuit Simulator

## Overview

Initial attempt at a Python circuit simulator which shows graphs for some given
values of capacitance and resistance in a charging/discharging circuit. I would
like to use this for GUI building practice as well.

## Tasks

  - need to design the GUI
  - add the variations on component values
  - graph plotting (V/t)
  - charge/discharge toggle
  - possibly step back/forward in time?
